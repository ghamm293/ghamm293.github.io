         <p>Artist Statement:</p>
         <p>
            This is the paradox we live in: not knowing the suffering around us but being surrounded by the evidence. My greatest desire for this series is to bring awareness to the evidence of suffering around us because suffering cannot be alleviated if it is not recognized. My works in graphite, watercolour, and sculpture are an illustration of both hiding and expressing emotion. My insight came from individuals and their stories of loss and internalized pain. Each subject within my artwork symbolically bleeds, representing the internal suffering, while their faces remain expressionless.

            Emotional suppression versus outward expression became my greatest inspiration for my artwork when I started to understand more about purpose in art. Emotion is such an integral part of our lives that there is no way to fully extricate ourselves from it, especially in art. Art can become an empty shell that will sooner or later lack any meaning or purpose when emotions and feelings are denied and tucked away in their entirety.

             My art has found its continual source through the culmination of both my studies in art and biblical counseling. The vision and desire in working through all the different mediums I had learned, was to explore and express, in an uncommon way, common emotions that bind us together as ordinary people. I found myself looking to several sources as I cultivated my vision for art I am presently working in and art I have planned for the future. Psalms were the inspiration to many of my studies in loss and especially influenced my expression of hopelessness, while my studies in biblical perspectives of mental illnesses also gave me great insight as to how I would create my pieces. In the art world, Picassoâ€™s Blue Period influenced much of my work aesthetically. The deep emotion expressed in both colour and design moved me in my palette choice towards deep colours that would bring life to my subject. Culturally, I have especially appreciated the different motifs that represent pain and mourning within the Asian community. Each of these influences played an integral part in the creation of my vision for this series.

             My art delves into the depths of human emotion and my own personal experiences of suffering and loss which became my soul's expression. My soul-- a God-created entity--was poured into the tangible reality of my artwork to give comfort in common experience. I hope my artwork opens a window of understanding for both relief and discernment of common human suffering.
